# RestaurantApp
Web app for restaurants to notify their customers when their orders are ready. Spring Boot, Java, HTML, CSS, JS, Tomcat, and AWS were used.

Note: Please email me at Bzahory@gmail.com if you are an employer, and you would like for me to reset the website (empty any new Menu/Order entries).
Regardless, I'll do it every few days or so.
